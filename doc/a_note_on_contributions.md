### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Project 3: Weakly supervised learning: label noise and correction

Team members: Yuxin Liang, Nixon Mckenzie, Safira Raharjo, Yi Sun, Yixun Xu, Haoyu Zhang

Summary: In this project, we conducted an analysis of weakly supervised learning on an imbalanced image dataset. For Model I, we used a more sophisticated model than the baseline and experimented with pre-trained neural network models such as VGG and ResNet. We achieved around 40% accuracy by treating the noisy labels as clean ones. For Model II, we decided to continue the usage of VGG in Model I and added a label correction method suggested by Inoue et al. (2017) to address the label noise issue. We achieved around 70% accuracy, a significant improvement over the baseline model.

[Contribution Statement] Yuxin Liang, Nixon Mckenzie, Safira Raharjo, Yi Sun, Yixun Xu, and Haoyu Zhang all contribute in finding the best model for Model 1 and Model 2. By comparing the proformance of both model 1 and model 2 of everybody, we chose Yixun Xu's VGG for highest accuracy above 70%!

Yi Sun utilized the ResNet50 pre-model for model 1 and denoise the imbalance dataset by training models use co-teaching technique. Co-teaching is a fancy way to deal with noisy labels and Yi Sun shared it during the meeting. But two bad teachers cannot solve problems either, the best outcome is around 31%.

Thank you very much for everybody's effort and we have created a wonderful Image Classifier to classify images correctly.
